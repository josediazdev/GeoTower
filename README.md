# GeoTowerAPI
Versi√≥n: 1.0

### Description:

This web application is designed to store and visualize real-time weather data collected from various weather stations. Built using Django as the backend framework, PostgreSQL for database management, and HTML/CSS for the frontend interface, the app provides a seamless experience for monitoring weather conditions. The core functionality includes an API REST endpoint that receives data from external devices via HTTP requests, enabling efficient data collection and storage. Additionally, the app features secure user authentication to ensure data privacy and controlled access.

### Technologies Implemented

- Backend: Django (Python)

- Database: PostgreSQL

- Frontend: HTML, CSS

The primary objective of this project is to create a robust API REST to handle real-time data from external devices, providing a hands-on learning experience in backend development, API design, and secure user management. This project serves as a foundational platform for future API implementations and continuous improvements to the application.

### Key Features:

- API REST for Data Ingestion: A RESTful API endpoint to receive and store data from external devices via HTTP requests.

- Weather Station Management: Users can add weather stations and visualize data from their sensors in real time.

- Community Forum: A built-in forum where users can ask questions, share knowledge, and receive answers from more experienced users, fostering a collaborative community around the project.


### Future Improvements

- Enhance data visualization with interactive charts and graphs.

- Expand API capabilities to support more complex data structures.

- Optimize database performance for large-scale data storage.
